# BitPredict
Forecasting future Bitcoin prices!
* Created a Naive Forecast as a Baseline.
* Used various models using Dense layers, Conv1D and RNN(LSTM).
* Created a N-Beats class for N-Beats Algorithm.
* Found that most of these models were less accurate than Naive Forecast.
* Ensembled all models to build a bigger model.
* FInally, trained a model on all historical data to forecast prices.
